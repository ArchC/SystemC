-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                IMPORTANT

1. This is the release of SystemC 2.3.2. This release contains bug fixes
   for SystemC 2.3.1 (and earlier) as well as adding some minor and
   experimental features.

2. This release is supported on the following platform combinations for
   which it has been tested:

    o 64-bit Linux (x86_64)
      (RedHat Enterprise 6; SuSE Enterprise Linux 11; Debian 9)
      - GNU C++ compiler versions gcc-4.2.2 through gcc-7.2.0
      - Clang C++ compiler versions clang-3.4 through clang-5.0
      - Intel C++ Compiler (ICC 15.0.0)

    o 64-bit Linux (x86_64) with 32-bit compiler (--host=i686-linux-gnu)
      (SuSE Enterprise Linux 11)
      - GNU C++ compiler versions gcc-4.2.2 through gcc-7.2.0
      - Intel C++ Compiler (ICC 15.0.0)

    o 64-bit Linux (aarch64)
      (Ubuntu 16.04)
      - GNU C++ compiler version gcc-4.5.0

    o 64-bit Mac OS X (x86_64)
      (10.12 Sierra)
      - Apple LLVM version 8.0 (clang-800.0.42.1)
      - GNU C++ compiler (MacPorts) versions gcc-4.9.0, gcc-5.4.0, gcc-6.3.0

    o Microsoft Windows
      (Windows Server 2008, Windows 10 Enterprise)
      - Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (10.0) (Win32 and x64)
      - Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 (12.0) (Win32 and x64)
      - Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (14.0) (Win32 and x64)
      - Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (14.1) (Win32 and x64)

      Warning: The fixed-point datatypes are not working as defined on
               MSVC 2015/2017 (x64) in Release mode.  See RELEASENOTES.

    o Windows Server 2008 (WoW64), Msys 1.0.17(0.48/3/2)
      - MinGW-w64 GNU C++ compiler version 4.9.2 (x86_64)


  This release has not yet been tested or is known not to work as expected
  on the following formerly supported platforms:

    o GNU C++ compiler versions prior to 4.2.x (all platforms)
    o FreeBSD 9.0 or later (x86, x86_64) with GNU C++ compiler
    o HP-UX 11.00 or later with GNU C++ or HP C++ compiler
    o Sun/Oracle Solaris, with GNU C++ or Sun/Solaris Studio compiler
    o Mac OS X prior to 10.12 (Sierra) and/or on the x86, PowerPC architectures
    o Microsoft Visual C++ versions prior to 10.0 (2010)
    o Cygwin 1.7 or later (x86, x86_64) with GNU C++ compiler
    o Msys/MinGW32 GNU C++ compiler


3. (In)compatibility note

  While it is possible to build SystemC as a shared library (both on
  ELF-based systems and well as a DLL on Windows), there is no explicitly
  defined binary interface across different

    - SystemC implementations (e.g. from multiple vendors)
    - SystemC library versions
    - Compilers or compiler versions
    - Operating systems or OS versions

  Some differences might be caught at link time, while other incompatibilities
  could just sliently lead to undefined behavior during simulation.  Please
  carefully ensure a consistent build configuration, when integrating binary
  SystemC models built from separate sources.
